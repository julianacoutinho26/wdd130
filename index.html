        <p>Welcome to my home page!! My name
            is Juiana Coutinho and I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am 18 years old and my first
            contact with the web development 'world' was in high school, and since then I have been
            interested in this area. Besides my interest for the tech world, I also dedicate my
            time
            for other hobbies, such as crochet, swiming, piano and flute.</p>
